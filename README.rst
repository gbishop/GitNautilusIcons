:Description: A really simple Nautilus extension to display emblems on Git controlled files.

Status
======

I use it, you can too. 

Installation
============

Put git-icon-emblems.py in ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts

I installed the emblems using Nautiuls Edit -> Backgrounds and Emblems ... -> Add New Emblem, type its name,
click the image, browse to it, select it, repeat. But I think it must be possible to just copy something
to ~/.icons/hicolor/48x48/emblems giving them the correct names.
