:Description: A really simple Nautilus extension to display emblems on Git controlled files.

Status
======

I use it, you can too. 

Installation
============

Put git-icon-emblems.py in ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts

I installed the emblems using Nautiuls Edit -> Backgrounds and Emblems ... -> Add New Emblem, type its name,
click the image, browse to it, select it, repeat. At least on Ubuntu Lucid you should be able to copy
the included hicolor folder to ~/.icons/ and it should just work. Your mileage may vary.
